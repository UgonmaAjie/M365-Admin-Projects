# Implementing Phishing Protection in M365

## Problem Statement
A company is experiencing an increase in phishing emails, posing a significant security risk. The security team needs to implement protection mechanisms to reduce phishing risks in M365.

## Solution Overview
This solution utilizes Microsoft 365 (M365) security features to protect against phishing attacks. The implementation involves:

1. **Microsoft Defender for Office 365**: Configuring anti-phishing policies and settings to detect and block phishing emails.
2. **Exchange Online Protection (EOP)**: Setting up anti-phishing rules and filters to further enhance email security.
3. **Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)**: Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies to reduce the risk of compromised accounts.
